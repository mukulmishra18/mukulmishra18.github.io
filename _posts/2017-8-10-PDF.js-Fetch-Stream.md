## Hello !!

This is the sixth post in the series of my **Google Summer of Code 2017** experience. In [last post](http://mukulmishra.me/blog/PDF.js-Node-Stream/), I gave overview of implementing of node_stream and how it is going to help to stream to stream PDF data in node.js environment. In this post, I am going to give updates of [my project](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/projects/4) _Streams API in PDF.js_.


In this post I am going to talk about the implementation details of `fetch_stream` and why we need it. PDF.js uses XHR to request PDF data(both from remote and local system), but response of XHR is not streamable. This resists streaming data small chunks of data in netwotking part of PDF.js. Although we implemented `node_stream`, and it's response is streamable, but we can only use this in node.js environment.

This is solvable using [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-api), or even better substitute for XHR. [fetch_stream](https://github.com/mukulmishra18/pdf.js/commit/84d492d03bdc5ff9622a258f75b7b7fc296ebc74) implements [IPDFStream](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/worker.js#L62) to request/read PDF data using fetch api. As fetch response is streamable, we can read in small chunks and control the flow of internal buffer. [PDFFetchStream](https://github.com/mukulmishra18/pdf.js/commit/84d492d03bdc5ff9622a258f75b7b7fc296ebc74#diff-ffa21364c93bc3328ab1eb76226f8a71R19) implements stream reader to read PDF data using fetch api internally.

**Comparison between XHR and Fetch API:**

If we compare `XHR` and `Fetch`, you will see a huge difference in terms of API design. `Fetch` give a set a clean api that are easy to use as compare to `XHR`. Here is a small example to request json using these two technologies:

```javascript
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', url);
xhr.responseType = 'json';

xhr.onload = () => {
  // Do something when request completes successfully.
}

xhr.onerror = () => {
  // Do somethig when request fails.
  console.log('BOOO...');
}

xhr.send();
```

```javascript
fetch(url).then((response) => {
  // Do something with retrieved data.
  // `body` property of response returns `ReadableStream`.
  let readableStream = response.body;
  let reader = readableStream.getReader();
}).catch((error) => {
  // Do something when error occured.
  console.log('BOOO...');
});
```
