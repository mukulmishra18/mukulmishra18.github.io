## Hello,

I think i am bit late to write this post, but here i am. This is first post about
my **Google Summer of Code 2017** experience.

This summer is going to be fun, because i got selected for **_Google Summer of Code_** with
**_Mozilla_** as mentoring organisation. During this period, i will be working on one of the core projects of Mozilla Labs [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js). [My project](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/projects/4) is to use [Streams API](https://github.com/whatwg/streams) in PDF.js networking and rendering task, to make it more efficient in terms of speed and memory.

I already had some chat about the project with my mentor(**_Yury Delendik_**), and we both are
preety exicted to see our project in action. It is already been half a month since i officially started working, and it is good to say that we are going on a decent pace.

When i was exploring Streams API, i found an excellent [blog post](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/streams-ftw/). This post contains almost everything needs to learn to understand Streams API, with great working examples.

I will publish more post regarding my project's update in future. So stay tuned!!!!
